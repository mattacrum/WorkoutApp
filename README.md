# WorkoutApp

## About
Purpose of this app is to help with workouts involving boxing using some signal processing. It will count the amount of punches thrown during a workout
and help the user keep track of his/her progress by showing the workout stats.

## Tech used
This app is built using Python, Soundfile, Numpy, sklearn and TKinter for GUI.

## How to Run
This app is being built on Python using TKinter for the GUI. Once finished all you need to do is run the appGUI.py file. 
Currently running the main.py or punchID.py files work. The main file starts a timer and counts the punches while it records
live. The punchID file takes in a previously recorded WAV file and counts the punches.
